1. The pipelines execute select resultset based on the range

To determine the range :
==========================
1. Select the total records from the table
2. Distribute the results to the number of determined threads
3. Derive the min and max range for each pipeline reader as follows:
 -let first result is the start of the range and maxresult is the end of the first range.
 -Determine the number of range for each thread
   Ex : let the count = 1000 and number of threads = 2. Then range for first thread is:
    thread-1 : minrange = 1 - maxrange= 500
    thread-2 : minrange = 501 - maxrange= 1000
   
   thread-1 : select * from table where rowid >=1   and rowid <=500
   thread-2 : select * from table where rowid >=501 and rowid <=1000
